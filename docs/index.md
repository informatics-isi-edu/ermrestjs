# ERMrestJS -- ERMrest client library in JavaScript

This site is the home for documentation about ERMrestJS, a Javascript client API for the
[ERMrest](http://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/ermrest) service. It provides a higher-level, simplified interface for working with the entity-relationship concepts that are native to ERMrest.
